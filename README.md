Hello! My name is LuÃ­s Costa, and I'm currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering in Polytechnic University of Castelo Branco and thrive on tackling new challenges and solving complex problems. My favorite interests are .Net, Back-End Development, JAVA and i'm starting to explore more deeply the Artificial Intelligence. These areas fascinate me since i become a software developer enthusiast, but can work in any technology. In my leisure time, I like to read books, practice music and working in my personal projects.

Skills: JS / HTML / CSS / JAVA / PHP / C#
